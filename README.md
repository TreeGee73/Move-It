  ## Description
Create a workout tracker using a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and routes handled with Express

  ## Usage
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

This app can be run by accessing through Heroku here [https://shrouded-springs-06094.herokuapp.com/](https://shrouded-springs-06094.herokuapp.com/).
